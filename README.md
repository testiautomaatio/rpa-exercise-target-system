# RPA exercise target system

This repository contains a simple React application that serves as a target system for RPA exercises. The application is
relatively simple and straightforward. It expects the user to input certain data, which is then validated and stored
locally. If the user succeeds to input each data item from an input correctly, the application will display a success message.

## Development

Start the developments server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Building for Production

Create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```
